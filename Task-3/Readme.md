# Task 3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
 As part of the task, I have completed the following steps:

#  Wrote Terraform Code
Used the Docker provider in main.tf to define and provision a local Nginx container.

# Initialized Terraform Project
Executed terraform init to download required Docker provider plugins.

# Planned Infrastructure
Ran terraform plan to review the execution plan and verify that Terraform will create the expected resources.

# Created Infrastructure
Successfully executed terraform apply to create a Docker container locally 

# Verified Container
Confirmed the container is running using docker ps, and accessed the Nginx welcome page in a browser.
